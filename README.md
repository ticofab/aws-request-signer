aws-request-signer
==================

Helper to evaluate the signing headers for HTTP requests to Amazon Web Services. This is a Scala port of (part of) the Java [aws-signing-request-interceptor](https://github.com/inreachventures/aws-signing-request-interceptor).

I originally needed this library to support AWS' [Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/), but this library is 'AWS service agnostic'.


Import via SBT
--------------

Currently available only for scala 2.11. In your build.sbt file,

```sbt
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo

libraryDependencies += "io.ticofab" %% "aws-request-signer" % "0.4.1"
```

Usage
-----

The procedure to sign AWS Api requests is described on the [official documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html). The idea is that each request must be signed through the evaluation of a hash which depends on the very request itself. The resulting string can then be added to the request either as a header or as a query param. This library focuses on the header way.

You first need to instantiate the signer, for example:

```scala
val awsCredentialProvider = new StaticCredentialsProvider(new BasicAWSCredentials("YOUR-ID", "YOUR-SECRET"))
val service = "es"
val region = "eu-central-1"
def clock(): LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(ZoneId.of("UTC"))
val signer = io.ticofab.AwsSigner(awsCredentialProvider, region, service, clock)
```

Then use it for each request, via

```scala
def getSignedHeaders(uri: String,
                     method: String,
                     queryParams: Map[String, String],
                     headers: Map[String, String],
                     payload: Option[Array[Byte]]): Map[String, String]
```


Check the examples in the test folder of this project. Once you have the headers, add them to your HTTP request and fire it.
